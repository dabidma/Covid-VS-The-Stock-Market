## Project Title: 
The Effects of Covid on the Stock Market

## Team Members: 
Don'yelle Allorh-quarcoo, David Ma, Dejan Savic, Mary Stewart, Wendell K

## Project Description/Outline: 
We would like to determine how stocks have performed before, during, and after covid using 2019, 2020, and 2021 data as our indicators, respectively. We will be pulling data from open resources such as Finviz for stock market data, the CDC for a covid timeline, and an API provided by Finnhub.io. To use the stock market data, we will be pulling in the monthly open and close prices and using those to calculate and measure monthly change in the stock price for each year in question. Then we will overlay a timeline of specific covid events over the stock charts to indicate possible relationships. By doing so we will be able to analyze if there was a direct correlation between the stock market and the effects of Covid-19.

## Research Questions to Answer:
1. Did different stocks perform differently pre-covid, during covid, and after covid?
2. Did different sectors perform differently pre-covid, during covid, and after covid?
3. Was there a change in volume during pre-covid, during covid, and after covid?
4. Do the number of covid cases in the country affect the price of the stocks?
5. Does the growth rate in covid cases affect the price of the stocks?
6. Do different “covid milestones” have an effect on specific stocks?
7. Can we use a linear regression analysis to predict the future price of stocks?      
8. Is there a correlation between any of the above mentioned factors with stock prices?
9. What sector was most affected by Covid-19?
10. Which sectors had the most sustained success?

## Datasets to be Used:
Finnhub.io API for stock data and covid data

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
	Pull and clean data from the API
	Create the calculations for our price analysis
	Pick 2 stocks from 5 sectors (Basic Materials, Communication Services, Consumer Defensive, Healthcare, Tech)
		-grab the top 2 highest market caps for analysis
		-Create graphs for each data set - pie charts for all of course
	Get data sets from covid cases
		-Create graphs for covid for the during and after covid year
	Plot covid miles stones i.e first vaccine, shutdown, toilet paper crisis, re-openings of shutdowns, tiktok
	Create a written summary of the questions we asked.
	Create slideshow for presentation
